            <h1 style="color: #fff;"> Food Import Procedure in India and FSSAI’s Latest Regulatory Changes
            </h1>
            <p style="color: #fff;">
                We discuss the step-by-step procedures for food imports in India, highlighting the latest regulatory
                advisory from the industry regulator, FSSAI, which streamlines clearance procedures for certain imported
                ingredients and food items. This recent move by FSSAI simplifies import processes, leading to reduced
                time and costs for importers. Notably, this move expands access to vital raw materials, providing
                significant advantages to manufacturers and processors aiming to create high-quality export-oriented
                products.

                The grocery industry has undergone significant changes in the last two years. According to a report by
                McKinsey, the global grocery retail market has been reshaped by trends that emerged during the pandemic
                and
                are persisting. For instance, the percentage of e-commerce grocery sales in the US market was
                slightly
                under 4 percent in December 2019; it’s now in the low teens and is expected to reach roughly 25
                percent by
                2030. <br> The adoption of online grocery is expected to be even higher in parts of Europe. <br>
                Another report by Oracle highlights that the disruptions of the past two years left grocery retailers
                with
                various challenges to serve their consumers. Consumer demand shifted dramatically as demand for cleaning
                and
                health items skyrocketed. Desperate consumers emptied out store aisles, revealing the vulnerabilities in
                grocers’ supply chains. <br>


                In addition, the food supply chain has undergone a world-wide transformation over the past two years as
                the
                needs of consumers have impacted many areas of the industry, including the closure of many restaurants
                and
                the spike in supermarket sales. <br>

                As 2023 unfolds, the disruptions of COVID-19 are starting to fade for grocery retailers, though price
                inflation and shortages of some supplies persist.
